        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. <br> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br> CSS
        is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate <em>.css</em> file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the <em>.css</em> file to be cached to improve
        the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. <br> Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,
        in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. <br> CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name cascading comes from the specified
        priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
